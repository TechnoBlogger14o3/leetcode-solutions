# Validate Binary Search Tree (Medium)

**Problem ID:** 98  
**Problem Number:** 130  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:


	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys&nbsp;strictly less than the node&#39;s key.
	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node&#39;s key.
	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:


Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,...
