# Is Graph Bipartite? (Medium)

**Problem ID:** 785  
**Problem Number:** 45  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite

## Problem Statement

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:


	There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
	There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
	If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (...
