# Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor (Medium)

**Problem ID:** 1026  
**Problem Number:** 354  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b&nbsp;or any child of a is an ancestor of b.

Example 1:


Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among al...
