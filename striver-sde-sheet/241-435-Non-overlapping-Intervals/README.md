**Problem ID:** 435  
**Problem Number:** 241  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals

## Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.

Example 1:


Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.


Example 2:


Input: intervals =...
