**Problem ID:** 1143  
**Problem Number:** 376  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.


	For example, &quot;ace&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;abcde&quot;.


A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
