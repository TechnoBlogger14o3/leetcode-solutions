# K Closest Points to Origin (Medium)

**Problem ID:** 973  
**Problem Number:** 363  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin

## Problem Statement

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., &radic;(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
