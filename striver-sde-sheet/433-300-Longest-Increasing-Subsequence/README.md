**Problem ID:** 300  
**Problem Number:** 433  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4


Example 3:


Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1


&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2500
	-104 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 104
