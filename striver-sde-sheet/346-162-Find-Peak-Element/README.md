# Find Peak Element (Medium)

**Problem ID:** 162  
**Problem Number:** 346  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element

## Problem Statement

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -&infin;. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]...
