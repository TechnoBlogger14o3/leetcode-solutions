## Problem Statement

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 &lt;= k &lt; nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by&nbsp;3&nbsp;indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, retur...
