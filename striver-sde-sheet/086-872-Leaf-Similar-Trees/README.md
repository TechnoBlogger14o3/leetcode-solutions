# Leaf-Similar Trees (Easy)

**Problem ID:** 872  
**Problem Number:** 86  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees

## Problem Statement

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from&nbsp;left to right order, the values of those&nbsp;leaves form a leaf value sequence.



For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar&nbsp;if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Example 1:


Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,n...
