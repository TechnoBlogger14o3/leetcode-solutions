## Problem Statement

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:


	countAndSay(1) = &quot;1&quot;
	countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).


Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string &quot;3322251&quo...
