# Repeated DNA Sequences (Medium)

**Problem ID:** 187  
**Problem Number:** 441  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences

## Problem Statement

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as &#39;A&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, and &#39;T&#39;.


	For example, &quot;ACGAATTCCG&quot; is a DNA sequence.


When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAA...

## Solutions

- Python: `solution.py`
- Java: `solution.java`
- JavaScript: `solution.js`
