**Problem Number:** 323  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a &quot;linked list&quot;:


	The &quot;linked list&quot; should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
	The &quot;linked list&quot; should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]


Example 2:


Input: root = []
Output:...
