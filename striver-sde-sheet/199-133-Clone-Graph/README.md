## Problem Statement

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.


class Node {
    public int val;
    public List&lt;Node&gt; neighbors;
}


&nbsp;

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node&#39;s value is the same as the node&#39;s index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the...
