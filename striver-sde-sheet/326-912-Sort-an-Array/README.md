# Sort an Array (Medium)

**Problem ID:** 912  
**Problem Number:** 326  
**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

&nbsp;
Example 1:


Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).


Example 2:


Input: nums = [...

## Solutions

- Python: `solution.py`
- Java: `solution.java`
- JavaScript: `solution.js`

**Note:** Solutions need to be implemented.
