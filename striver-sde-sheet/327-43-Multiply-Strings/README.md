## Problem Statement

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note:&nbsp;You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

&nbsp;
Example 1:
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
Example 2:
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= num1.length, num2.length &lt;= 200
	num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
	Both num1 and num2&nbsp;do not...
