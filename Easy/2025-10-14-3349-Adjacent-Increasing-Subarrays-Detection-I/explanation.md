## Approach

To solve the problem of detecting two adjacent strictly increasing subarrays of length `k` in the given array `nums`, we can follow a straightforward approach based on sequential checks.

### Problem-Solving Approach:

1. **Understanding the Structure**: We need to identify pairs of subarrays of length `k` that are adjacent in the array. Specifically, if one subarray starts at index `a`, the next must start at index `b = a + k`.

2. **Iterate through the Array**: We can iterate through the array from index `0` to `n - 2k`, where `n` is the length of `nums`. This ensures that we can safely check both subarrays without going out of bounds.

3. **Check for Strictly Increasing Subarrays**:
   - For each starting index `a`, check if the subarray `nums[a..a + k - 1]` is strictly increasing. This means each element must be less than the next one.
   - If the first subarray is strictly increasing, then check the next subarray starting at index `b = a + k`, i.e., `nums[b..b + k - 1]`.

4. **Return Result**: If both subarrays are found to be strictly increasing, return `true`. If the loop completes without finding such pairs, return `false`.

### Data Structures:
- We primarily utilize the input array `nums` and simple integer indices to track our position in the array. No additional complex data structures are needed.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(n * k) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because for each starting index, we may need to check up to `k` elements to confirm if the subarray is strictly increasing.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach is efficient given the constraints and effectively checks for the required conditions in a straightforward manner.
