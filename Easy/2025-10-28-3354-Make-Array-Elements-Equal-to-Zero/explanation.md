## Approach

To solve the problem of determining the number of valid selections of starting positions and movement directions that can turn all elements of the array `nums` to zero, we can utilize a systematic approach based on simulation and validation.

### Approach:

1. **Identify Starting Positions**: First, we need to locate all the indices in the array `nums` where the value is zero. These indices represent potential starting positions (`curr`) for our simulation.

2. **Simulate Movement**: For each zero position, we will simulate the process of decrementing the values in the array while following the movement rules. We can choose two initial movement directions: left and right. The simulation will involve:
   - Starting at the chosen index (`curr`).
   - Moving in the selected direction.
   - If we encounter a zero, we continue in the same direction.
   - If we encounter a positive number, we decrement it by one, reverse the direction, and take a step in the new direction.

3. **Check Completion**: For each simulation, we need to check if all elements in `nums` become zero by the end of the process. If they do, we count this as a valid selection.

4. **Data Structures**: We will primarily use an array to represent `nums`, and we may use a boolean flag or a counter to track whether all elements have been turned to zero during the simulation.

5. **Complexity**: The complexity of this approach is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the array. This is because for each of the zero positions (up to n), we may need to simulate the movement which could involve traversing the entire array multiple times.

### Summary:
The solution involves iterating through the indices of the array where the value is zero, simulating the decrementing process for both left and right directions, and checking if all elements can be turned to zero. The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints, making this approach feasible for input sizes up to 100.
