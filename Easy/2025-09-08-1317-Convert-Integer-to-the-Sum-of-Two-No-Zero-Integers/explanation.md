## Approach

To solve the problem of converting an integer \( n \) into the sum of two no-zero integers \( a \) and \( b \), we can use a straightforward iterative approach.

### Approach:

1. **Understanding No-Zero Integers**: A no-zero integer is defined as a positive integer that does not contain the digit '0' in its decimal representation. Thus, valid integers must consist only of the digits 1 through 9.

2. **Iterative Search**: We can iterate through possible values for \( a \) starting from 1 up to \( n-1 \). For each value of \( a \), we can compute \( b \) as \( b = n - a \). 

3. **Checking for No-Zero Condition**: After calculating \( b \), we need to check if both \( a \) and \( b \) are no-zero integers. This can be done by converting each integer to a string and verifying that it does not contain the digit '0'.

4. **Returning the Result**: As soon as we find a valid pair \( (a, b) \) that satisfies the conditions, we can return this pair as the result.

### Data Structures:
- We primarily use integers for \( a \) and \( b \).
- String representation is used for checking the presence of the digit '0'.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case scenario involves iterating through values from 1 to \( n-1 \), resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n) \). However, since we are guaranteed that a solution exists, we will typically find a valid pair much sooner.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) as we are using a constant amount of space to store the integers \( a \) and \( b \).

This approach is efficient given the constraints \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and ensures that we can find a solution quickly by leveraging the properties of no-zero integers.
