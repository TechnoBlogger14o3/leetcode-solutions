## Problem Template

Each problem folder follows the structure:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-ProblemID-Title/
├── solution.java                # Java solution code
├── solution.js                  # JavaScript solution code
├── solution.py                  # Python solution code
└── explanation.md               # Problem statement, approach, complexities
```

## Statistics

- **Total Problems Solved**: 10
- **Easy**: 2
- **Medium**: 6
- **Hard**: 2

## Getting Started

1. Create a new problem folder using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-ProblemID-Title`
2. Add your solution code in `solution.java`, `solution.js`, and `solution.py`
3. Document your approach in `explanation.md`
4. Update this README with the new problem entry

## Documentation Standards

Each problem includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the problem requirements
- **Examples**: Sample inputs and expected outputs
- **Approach**: Step-by-step explanation of the solution strategy
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity breakdown
- **Key Insights**: Important observations and learning points
- **Alternative Approaches**: Other possible solution methods
- **Multi-language Solutions**: Implementations in Java, JavaScript, and Python

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental data structures and algorithms
- Develop efficient problem-solving strategies
- Practice code optimization and performance analysis
- Improve understanding of time and space complexity
- Build confidence in tackling algorithmic challenges

## Notes

- All solutions are organized by difficulty level
- Each problem includes solutions in both Java and JavaScript
- Detailed explanations and complexity analysis included
- Solutions are date-stamped for tracking progress
- Focus on understanding rather than memorization
