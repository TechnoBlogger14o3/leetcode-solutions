# Soup Servings - Problem #808

## Problem Statement
There are two types of soup: **type A** and **type B**. Initially, we have `n` ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of operations:

1. Serve 100 ml of **soup A** and 0 ml of **soup B**
2. Serve 75 ml of **soup A** and 25 ml of **soup B**
3. Serve 50 ml of **soup A** and 50 ml of **soup B**
4. Serve 25 ml of **soup A** and 75 ml of **soup B**

When we serve some soup, we give it to someone, and we no longer have it. Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with **equal probability** 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as we can. We stop once we no longer have some soup.

Note that we do not have an operation where all 100 ml's of **soup B** are used first.

Return the probability that **soup A** will be empty first, plus half the probability that **A** and **B** become empty at the same time. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

## Examples
```
Input: n = 50
Output: 0.62500
Explanation: If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first.
For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
For the last operation, B will become empty first.
So the answer is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

Input: n = 100
Output: 0.71875
```

## Approach
**Key Insight**: This is a dynamic programming problem with probability calculations. We need to consider all possible states and their transition probabilities.

**Algorithm**:
1. **State Definition**: `dp[i][j]` represents the probability that soup A becomes empty first (plus 0.5 times the probability that both become empty simultaneously) when we have `i` units of soup A and `j` units of soup B remaining.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `i <= 0` and `j <= 0`: return 0.5 (both empty simultaneously)
   - If `i <= 0`: return 1.0 (A empty first)
   - If `j <= 0`: return 0.0 (B empty first)

3. **Transitions**: From state `(i, j)`, we have 4 equally likely operations:
   - Serve (100, 0): go to state `(i-100, j)`
   - Serve (75, 25): go to state `(i-75, j-25)`
   - Serve (50, 50): go to state `(i-50, j-50)`
   - Serve (25, 75): go to state `(i-25, j-75)`

4. **Optimization**: Since the operations favor consuming soup A, for large values of `n`, the probability approaches 1.0. We can return 1.0 for `n >= 5000`.

5. **Unit Conversion**: To reduce computation, we can work with units of 25ml instead of 1ml.

**Why this works**:
- Each operation has equal probability (0.25)
- We need to account for all possible paths to reach terminal states
- The bias towards consuming more soup A means the probability increases with larger `n`

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) - We compute each state once
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²) - For the memoization table

## Key Insights
- The problem has a bias towards emptying soup A first
- For large values of n, the probability approaches 1.0
- We can optimize by working with larger units (25ml)
- Memoization is essential to avoid recomputing states

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Top-down DP with memoization**: Recursive approach with caching
2. **Bottom-up DP**: Iterative approach building from smaller states
3. **Mathematical analysis**: For very large n, direct approximation

                solve(a - 2, b - 2) +  # Serve 50ml A, 50ml B
                solve(a - 1, b - 3)    # Serve 25ml A, 75ml B

## Test Cases
```
Test Case 1:
Input: n = 50
Expected Output: 0.62500

Test Case 2:
Input: n = 100
Expected Output: 0.71875

Test Case 3:
Input: n = 0
Expected Output: 0.5

Test Case 4:
Input: n = 1
Expected Output: 0.625

Test Case 5:
Input: n = 5000
Expected Output: 1.0 (approximately)
```

## Edge Cases
1. n = 0 (both soups start empty)
2. Very small values of n (1-25)
3. Large values of n (>= 5000)
4. Values that are multiples of 25
5. Values that require ceiling division

## Mathematical Insight
The key mathematical insight is that the operations are biased towards consuming more soup A:
- Operation 1: Consumes 100ml A, 0ml B
- Operation 2: Consumes 75ml A, 25ml B  
- Operation 3: Consumes 50ml A, 50ml B
- Operation 4: Consumes 25ml A, 75ml B

On average, each operation consumes 62.5ml of A and 37.5ml of B, which means soup A will likely be depleted first, especially for larger values of n.

## Follow-up Questions
1. What if the probabilities of operations are not equal?
2. What if we add more types of operations?
3. What if we want the probability that soup B empties first?
4. How would the solution change with different serving sizes?
5. What if we have more than two types of soup?
