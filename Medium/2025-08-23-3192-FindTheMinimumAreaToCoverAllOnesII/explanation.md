# Find the Minimum Sum in Grid

## Problem Description
Given a 2D grid of integers, find the minimum sum that can be obtained by selecting the minimum value from each of two different rows and adding them together.

The problem requires finding the minimum sum of any two rows, where each row's contribution is the minimum value in that row.

## Approach
This is a grid optimization problem that requires finding the minimum sum of any two rows, where each row's contribution is the minimum value in that row. The key insight is to first find the minimum value in each row, then find the minimum sum of any two of these minimum values.

## Algorithm
1. **Find row minimums**: For each row, find the minimum value in that row
2. **Calculate minimum sum**: Find the minimum sum of any two row minimums
3. **Return result**: Return the minimum sum found

## Key Implementation Details
- **Row Minimum Tracking**: Use an array to store the minimum value of each row
- **Two-Pass Approach**: First pass to find row minimums, second pass to find minimum sum
- **Sum Calculation**: Compare all possible pairs of row minimums
- **Edge Case Handling**: Check for empty matrix and handle edge cases

## Mathematical Intuition
The minimum sum must:
- **Use row minimums**: Each row contributes its minimum value
- **Select two rows**: We need exactly two different rows
- **Minimize total**: Find the pair with the smallest sum

The sum is calculated as:
```
minSum = min(rowMin[i] + rowMin[j]) for all i ≠ j
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(m × n) where m and n are the dimensions of the matrix
- **Space**: O(1) - only using constant extra space

## Example
- Input: [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
- Process: 
  - Row 0 minimum: 1
  - Row 1 minimum: 4
  - Row 2 minimum: 7
  - Minimum sum: min(1+4, 1+7, 4+7) = min(5, 8, 11) = 5
- Output: 5 (1 + 4)

## Key Insights
- **Row Minimums**: Each row contributes its minimum value to the sum
- **Pair Selection**: We need to find the best pair of two different rows
- **Efficient Calculation**: Two-pass approach: first find row minimums, then find minimum sum
- **Optimal Strategy**: Always select the two rows with the smallest minimum values

## Alternative Approaches
- **Sorting**: Sort row minimums and take the sum of the first two
- **Heap**: Use a min-heap to find the two smallest row minimums
- **Single Pass**: Track the two smallest row minimums while scanning
- **Divide and Conquer**: Find minimums in submatrices and combine results

## Edge Cases
- **Empty Matrix**: Return 0
- **Single Row**: Return 0 (need at least two rows)
- **Single Column**: Handle single column case
- **All Same Values**: Handle when all values in a row are identical
- **Negative Values**: Handle negative numbers in the grid

## Applications
- **Data Analysis**: Find minimum cost combinations from different data sources
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize resource distribution across different groups
- **Network Optimization**: Find minimum cost paths or connections
- **Game Development**: Optimize player strategies or resource management
- **Financial Planning**: Find minimum cost investment combinations

## Optimization Opportunities
- **Single Pass**: Track the two smallest row minimums while scanning
- **Heap Data Structure**: Use min-heap to efficiently find smallest values
- **Parallel Processing**: Process rows independently to find minimums
- **Memory Optimization**: Use minimal extra space for tracking
