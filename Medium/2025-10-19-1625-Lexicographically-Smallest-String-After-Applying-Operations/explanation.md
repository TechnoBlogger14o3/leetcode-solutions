## Approach

To solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest string after applying the specified operations, we can use the following approach:

### Main Idea
The core idea is to explore all possible configurations of the string `s` by applying the two operations (adding `a` to odd indices and rotating the string) in a systematic manner. Given that both operations can be applied multiple times, we need to ensure we explore all combinations efficiently.

### Steps to Approach
1. **Rotation Generation**: Since the string can be rotated by `b` positions, we can generate all possible rotations of the string. For a string of length `n`, there are `n` unique rotations.

2. **Odd Index Addition**: For each rotation, we can apply the addition operation to the odd indices. Since adding `a` can be repeated, we can determine the final values at odd indices after multiple additions:
   - Each odd index can be transformed into a value that is the original value plus multiples of `a`, modulo 10. This means that for each odd index, we can compute all possible values it can take after applying the addition operation.

3. **Generate All Combinations**: For each rotation of the string, we can generate all combinations of the possible values for the odd indices while keeping the even indices unchanged. This gives us a new candidate string for each configuration.

4. **Lexicographical Comparison**: Maintain a variable to track the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the generation of candidate strings from all rotations and their respective odd index transformations.

### Data Structures
- **List/Array**: To store the rotations of the string.
- **Set/Array**: To keep track of possible values for odd indices after applying the addition operation.
- **String Variable**: To store the current smallest string found.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The overall complexity can be approximated as O(n^2) since we generate `n` rotations and for each rotation, we process `n/2` odd indices, leading to multiple combinations of transformations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing rotations and possible values.

By systematically exploring all rotations and transformations, we ensure that we find the lexicographically smallest string efficiently. This approach allows us to leverage the constraints of the problem while ensuring we do not miss any potential configurations.
