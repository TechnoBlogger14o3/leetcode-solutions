# Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps - Problem #2106

## Problem Statement
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a 1-dimensional garden. The garden is represented by an infinite 1-dimensional line. Alice and Bob start at position `startPos` and can move left or right along the line. There are `fruits` at various positions, where `fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti]` represents `amounti` fruits at position `positioni`.

Alice and Bob can harvest fruits by moving to the positions where fruits are located. They can move at most `k` steps in total. Each step moves them one position left or right. They can harvest all fruits at a position by visiting it.

Return the maximum number of fruits Alice and Bob can harvest.

## Examples
```
Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation: 
- Alice and Bob start at position 5
- Move left to position 2, harvest 8 fruits
- Move right to position 6, harvest 3 fruits
- Total steps: 3 + 4 = 7 > k, so this is not valid
- Alternative: Move left to position 2, harvest 8 fruits, then right to position 6, harvest 3 fruits
- Total steps: 3 + 4 = 7 > k, so this is not valid
- Best: Move left to position 2, harvest 8 fruits, then right to position 6, harvest 3 fruits
- Wait, let me recalculate: position 5 to 2 = 3 steps, 2 to 6 = 4 steps, total = 7 > k
- Actually, the optimal is: start at 5, go to 2 (3 steps), then to 6 (4 steps) = 7 steps > k
- Let me check the example again...

Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: 
- Alice and Bob start at position 5
- Move left to position 4, harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6, harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7, harvest 4 fruits
- Total steps: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 ≤ k, total fruits: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
- Alternative: Move left to position 4, harvest 1 fruit, then left to position 0, harvest 9 fruits
- Total steps: 1 + 4 = 5 > k, so this is not valid
- Best: Move left to position 4, harvest 1 fruit, then right to position 6, harvest 2 fruits, then right to position 7, harvest 4 fruits
- Total steps: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 ≤ k, total fruits: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
- Wait, let me recalculate the example...
```

## Approach
**Key Insight**: This is a sliding window problem where we need to find the maximum sum of fruits within a window that can be reached within `k` steps.

**Algorithm**:
1. Sort the fruits by position to get them in order.
2. Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of fruits that can be harvested within `k` steps.
3. For each window, calculate the minimum steps needed to reach all fruits in the window.
4. The minimum steps for a window from position `left` to `right` is: `right - left + min(left, right - left)`.

**Why this works**:
- We need to visit all fruits in a contiguous range
- The optimal path is to go to one end, then to the other end
- The total steps is the distance between the two ends plus the distance from start to the closer end

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Due to sorting the fruits by position
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Only using a few variables for the sliding window

## Key Insights
- Fruits must be harvested in a contiguous range
- The optimal path is: start → one end → other end
- Total steps = distance between ends + distance from start to closer end
- Use sliding window to find the maximum sum within the step constraint

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Brute Force**: Try all possible ranges - O(n²) time
2. **Binary Search**: Can be used to optimize the sliding window approach
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Can be used but overkill for this problem

## Test Cases

Test Case 1: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4 → 9
Test Case 2: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4 → 14
Test Case 3: fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2 → 0
Test Case 4: fruits = [[200000,10000]], startPos = 200000, k = 200000 → 10000
```

## Edge Cases
- No fruits can be reached within k steps
- All fruits are at the same position
- startPos is outside the range of fruits
- Large values for positions and amounts
