## Approach

To solve the problem of determining the minimum operations required to reduce all elements of a range to zero, we can break down the approach as follows:

### Problem Understanding
Given a range defined by `[l, r]`, we need to consider all integers in this range and understand how many operations are required to reduce each integer to zero. The operation allows us to select two integers \( a \) and \( b \) and replace them with \( \text{floor}(a / 4) \) and \( \text{floor}(b / 4) \). 

### Key Observations
1. **Operation Effectiveness**: Each operation effectively reduces the maximum of two selected numbers, and the reduction is significant since it divides the numbers by 4. Thus, the larger the numbers, the more impactful the operations will be.
2. **Binary Representation**: The number of operations required to reduce a number \( x \) to zero can be determined by examining its binary representation. Specifically, the number of times we can divide by 4 until we reach zero correlates with the highest power of 4 that fits into \( x \).
3. **Maximum Operations**: For any integer \( x \), the number of operations required can be derived from the formula: 
   - Count how many times \( x \) can be divided by 4 until it reaches zero. This is equivalent to \( \text{floor}(\log_4(x)) + 1 \).

### Approach
1. **Precomputation**: For each query, compute the maximum number of operations required for any integer in the range `[l, r]`. This can be done by:
   - Iterating through all integers from \( l \) to \( r \).
   - For each integer, calculate the number of operations needed using the logarithmic approach discussed.
   - Keep track of the maximum operations required across all integers in the range.
  
2. **Summation of Results**: After processing all queries, sum the results of the minimum operations required for each query.

### Data Structures
- **Array/List**: To store the results of each query.
- **Integer Variables**: To track the maximum operations for each range.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case scenario involves iterating through each query and each integer in the range, leading to a complexity of \( O(n \cdot m) \), where \( n \) is the number of queries and \( m \) is the average size of ranges. However, given the constraints, this approach may need optimization.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for storing intermediate results, aside from the input storage.

### Final Note
The solution's efficiency can be improved by recognizing patterns in the ranges or using mathematical properties of logarithms and powers to avoid explicit iteration through every number in the range. This would involve more advanced mathematical insights or data structures that can efficiently compute the required operations based on the properties of numbers in the specified ranges.
