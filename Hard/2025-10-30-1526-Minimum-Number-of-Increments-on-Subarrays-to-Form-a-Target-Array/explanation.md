## Approach

To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to transform an `initial` array of zeros into a `target` array using subarray increments, we can adopt a systematic approach based on the differences between consecutive elements of the `target` array.

### Main Idea:
The key observation is that the number of operations needed corresponds to the changes in values between adjacent elements of the `target`. Specifically, for each position in the `target`, if the value increases from one index to the next, we need to perform additional operations equal to that increase. Conversely, if the value decreases or remains the same, no new operations are needed for that transition.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a counter for operations set to zero.
2. **Iterate through the `target` array**:
   - For each index `i` from 1 to the end of the array, compare `target[i]` with `target[i-1]`.
   - If `target[i] > target[i-1]`, the difference `target[i] - target[i-1]` represents the number of increments needed to raise the value at index `i` to match the target. Add this difference to the operations counter.
3. **Account for the initial increments**: The first element of the `target` array will also require increments equal to its value since the initial array starts at zero.

### Data Structures:
- A simple integer counter to keep track of the total number of operations.
- The `target` array itself, which is already provided.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `target` array. This is because we perform a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables for counting and do not require any additional data structures that scale with input size.

### Conclusion:
By leveraging the differences between consecutive elements in the `target` array, we can efficiently compute the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the desired transformation. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for the problem's constraints.
