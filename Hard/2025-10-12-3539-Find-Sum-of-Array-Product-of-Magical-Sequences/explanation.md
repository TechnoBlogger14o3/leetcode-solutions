## Approach

To solve the problem of finding the sum of array products of magical sequences, we can break down the approach into several key steps:

### Main Idea:
The core of the problem revolves around generating all possible sequences of indices of length `m` from the given array `nums`, while ensuring that the binary representation of the sum of powers of two corresponding to these indices has exactly `k` set bits. For each valid sequence, we compute the product of the values in `nums` at these indices and sum them up.

### Steps to Approach:
1. **Bit Manipulation**: The condition regarding the set bits can be handled using bit manipulation. For a sequence of size `m`, we can represent it as a number where each bit signifies whether a particular index is included in the sequence. This means we need to check combinations of indices that yield exactly `k` set bits.

2. **Combinatorial Generation**: We can generate combinations of indices using backtracking or iterative methods. Given that `m` can be at most 30, the number of combinations is manageable. We can iterate through all possible combinations of indices from `0` to `nums.length - 1` and check the number of set bits in the binary representation of the sum of `2^seq[i]`.

3. **Product Calculation**: For each valid magical sequence (where the number of set bits equals `k`), we compute the product of the corresponding elements in `nums`. This can be done using a simple multiplication loop.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we continuously take the modulo `10^9 + 7` during our calculations to prevent overflow and ensure we stay within the required limits.

### Data Structures:
- **Combinations**: We can use a list or array to store the indices of the current sequence being generated.
- **Integer for Product**: A simple integer variable to accumulate the product of the elements in `nums` corresponding to the indices in the current sequence.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is primarily influenced by the number of combinations of indices we need to check, which is `O(n^m)` in the worst case (where `n` is the length of `nums` and `m` is the length of the sequence). However, since we are only interested in combinations with exactly `k` set bits, the effective number of combinations will be significantly less.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(m)` for storing the current sequence of indices being processed.

By following this structured approach, we can efficiently find the required sum of array products for all valid magical sequences.
